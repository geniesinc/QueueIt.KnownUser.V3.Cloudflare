# KnownUser.V3.Cloudflare
The Queue-it Security Framework is used to ensure that end users cannot reach to your protected backend routes without passing the virtual queue by performing a server-side validation before processing a request. This approach is using [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/kv/) to integrate a Cloudflare protected WebServer with [Queue-it](https://queue-it.com/). This repository is containing a JavaScript file `queueitknownuser.bundle.js` you add as a Worker to your Cloudflare distribution to protect your traffic going through Cloudflare.

## Introduction
When a user makes a request to your backend Cloudflare will trigger queue-it Worker, the  script validates the request and if it is needed, it will redirect the user to the queue. After waiting in the queue, the queue engine will redirect the user back to your end attaching a query string parameter (`queueittoken`) containing some information about the user to the URL.
The most important fields of the `queueittoken` are:

- q - the users' unique queue identifier
- ts - a timestamp of how long this redirect is valid
- h - a hash of the token

After the user is returned from the queue, the Worker script will let the user continue his request to your backend (without redirecting to the queue since the request has a valid queueittoken as querystring).

## Instruction
1. Browse to Cloudflare dashboard -> select Workers -> "Manage KV namespaces" -> in the "Namespace Name" field, enter `IntegrationConfigKV` -> click "Add"

2. In the upper-left side, select Workers -> "Create a Worker" -> clear the template code and paste the contents of `queueitknownuser.bundle.js`

3. Search for `QUEUEIT_CUSTOMERID` and `QUEUEIT_SECRETKEY` in `queueitknownuser.bundle.js` replace their values with your customerId and secretKey found in the Go Queue-It self-service platform 

4. If you have any action(s) with trigger(s) using the experimental request body condition, then search for `READ_REQUEST_BODY` and set this variable to true.

5. Rename worker to "queue-itconnector" (located in the upper-left corner)

6. Click Save and Deploy

7. Go back to the Worker Setup page by clicking the "<" button next to the new title of the newly created Worker

8. On the Worker setup page, select the toggle switch on "Deployed to `queue-itconnector.yoursite.workers.dev`" to deploy the Worker to production

9. On the "Settings" tab, under the "KV Namespace Bindings" heading, click the "Add variable" button. For "Variable name" enter "`IntegrationConfigKV`" and for "KV namespace" select "`IntegrationConfigKV`" from the dropdown which you had added before in Step 1. Click "Save".

10. Navigate back to the Cloudflare Dashboard and select "Workers" -> "Add route"

11. Exclude routes that should not have Queue-it enabled (e.g. https://PROTECTED.YOURDOMAIN.COM/MEDIA/*) by selecting the "NONE" worker (read more about the route matching here: [Cloudflare matching-behavior](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/routes/#matching-behavior)

12. Add routes you need to be protected by Queue-it (e.g. https://PROTECTED.YOURDOMAIN.COM/*)

13. Within the Go Queue-it Platform, set-up the Publish web endpoint (e.g. [PROTECTED ROUTE]/?__push_queueit_config) in Integration -> Overview -> Settings

14. Configure relevant Triggers and Actions in Go Queue-it

15. When ready to deploy the configuration, click Integration -> Overview -> Show/Hide Instructions and click the Publish Now button


### Protecting AJAX calls
If you need to protect AJAX calls beside page loads you need to add the below JavaScript tags to your pages:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="//static.queue-it.net/script/queueclient.min.js"></script>
<script
 data-queueit-intercept-domain="{YOUR_CURRENT_DOMAIN}"
   data-queueit-intercept="true"
  data-queueit-c="{YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID}"
  type="text/javascript"
  src="//static.queue-it.net/script/queueconfigloader.min.js">
</script>
```
### Combining queueit code with other custom codes
You can update app.js to execute your custom codes before or after calling queueit validation methods during request or response.
After changing the code in app.js you need use browserify to regenerate the bundle and then use it in your cloudflare distribution.
